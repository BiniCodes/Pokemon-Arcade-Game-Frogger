Project info:
This project is made for and with the Udacity Front-End Webdeveloper Nanodegree.



##Pokémon frogger Game

The game starts immediately after opening the index.html file.

The goal of the game is to take Pikachu safe to the other side of the street.
When the water is reached, the game is won and an alert window will display and ask
if the player wants to restart the game. WIth pressing 'okay' the game starts again.

*Take care!
If Pikachu collidates with one of the moving pokeballs he will be catched and
moves back to the starting point. The player will have to start again.

*Additions
Additonally, the Pikachu can collect stars to gather extra points.
	//Code information
	The feature to count the number of collected stars and to put the stars back to their
	initial point is not implemented, yet. For now it is only possible to simply 
	collect the stars.
