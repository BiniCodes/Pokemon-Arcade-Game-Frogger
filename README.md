##Pokémon frogger Game

The game starts immediately after opening the index.html file.

//The goal 

The goal of the game is to take Pikachu safe to the other side of the street.
Pikachu can be moved with the arrow keys of the keyboards. Press up to go forward, right arrow to go right, left arrow to go left
and down to go backwards. With this funcionality, try to use it to avoid the pokeballs.

*Take care!
If Pikachu collidates with one of the moving pokeballs he will be catched and
moves back to the initial point. The player looses all Stars (see below) and will have to start again.

//Additions

Additonally, Pikachu can collect stars to gather extra points.
Altogether Pikachu can collect eight stars. There are four stars displayed right from the beginning.
Those stars, will be displayed on new locations after collection,
so they can be collected again. Afterwards, every additional star collected, will disappear
from the screen. Therefore, there are eight stars in total to collect.
After the 8th star is collected, there should be no more stars left on the screen.

//Win 

When the water is reached, the game is won. An alert window will display the number of collected stars and ask
if the player wants to restart the game. With pressing 'okay' the game starts again.
